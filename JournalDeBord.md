2nd presentation of our progress. (https://1drv.ms/p/s!AhTm1sjPNY-GgjRiXmJ6r0E80x2i?e=7ZnZlr)
We have to make a lot of changes especially for the component (AOP LM324 has to be replaced by a better one with less distortion).
For the AOP we choose the MCP6002.
I begin test the preamp schematic on LTspice.

Study of the Supercell module on the RACKV2 software, presented by our mentor Mr. Fiack.

Buffer with 40 read heads (instead of one). With different positions. Each head has a wrapper. The trigg has a density. Pitch at 0 (= delay), pitch at high density (small clicks). Shape changes the shape of the envelope. Density, number of playback heads played.

### Definition of codec (wiki) : 

A codec is a hardware or software device used to encode or decode a digital data stream for transmission or storage. Some codecs also incorporate a data compression or encryption function.
The acronym "codec" comes from "coder-decoder".


Manufacturing steps : 

- Select components (codec + microprocessor)

- Design the PCB in Kikad

- Code the effect in CubeIDE
