## 🔧 Project structure
The project is divided into 2 parts: the first is analog, with the creation of the system's electronic board, and the second is the creation of the various digital audio effects.

To better organize our project, we have drawn up a task breakdown with each associated deliverable. This diagram is an integration of the WBS, OBS, and PBS charts.

- WBS = Work Breakdown Structure: hierarchical structures that break down complex operations into more manageable components
- PBS = Project Breakdown Structure: product organization chart: deliverables, breakdown, intermediate outputs
- OBS = Organization Breakdown Structure: How tasks are organized. The skills, responsibilities, relationships, etc. Individualization of tasks
